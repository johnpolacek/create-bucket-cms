# Bucket CMS CLI

Sometimes you don’t want a CMS, you just need a bucket. Bucket CMS is the lightest lightweight CMS around – ready for you to drop into your Next.js project. 

---

## Install

Bucket CMS is meant to be added into your existing Next.js project.

If you wish to start from scratch, begin by using `create-next-app` to [create a new Next.js project](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Once you have a Next.js project, you can add Bucket CMS with the following command:

```
npx create-bucket-cms
```

## Requirements

Commercial projects require purchasing a license for a fee. Non-commercial projects may use Bucket CMS for free. Find out more at [bucket-cms.com/pricing](https://www.bucket-cms.com/pricing)

Admin access to an S3 bucket on AWS is required to create and update data and file assets. For more information on this and setting up Bucket CMS, refer to the [Bucket CMS Docs](https://www.bucket-cms.com/docs)
